# :floppy_disk: Database2 JPA-project
This is the repository for the projects of the Database2 course held at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/).

The project aims to develop an application that interfaces with the company's database. The first component is a consumer application, allowing the company's customers to purchase services upon registration. The second component is an employee application, allowing the company's workers to log in, create custom Service Packs, and introduce new optional products. Additionally, employees can access a sales report page, where crucial sales data is displayed.

A relational database supports both applications. Triggers are used to organize information, collected in specific tables for better viewing.
The entire application is developed in Java, exploiting [JPA framework](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Persistence_API), meanwhile for the database MySQL was used. The front end is a simple HTML page
