# :floppy_disk: Database2 JPA-project
This is the repository for the projects of the Database2 course held at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/).

The goal of the project is to build a client applications using the same database for a company. The first is a consumer application in which the company's customers can buy the services offered upon registration. The second is an employee application in which the company's workers can log in and create custom Service Packs and new Optional products. They have also access to the sales report page, where all the major selling data are displayed.

A relational database supports both applications. Triggers are used to organize some types of information, collected in specific tables for better viewing.
The entire application is developed in Java, exploiting [JPA framework](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Persistence_API), meanwhile for the database MySQL was used. The frontend is a simple HTML page
